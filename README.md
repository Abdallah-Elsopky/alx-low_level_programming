# My First C Project

Welcome to my first C project! This is a small educational project where I am learning the basics of the C programming language.

## Description

This project contains simple C programs that demonstrate basic concepts such as:

- Printing text to the screen using `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar`.
- Basic input and output operations.
- Basic data types and variables.
- Simple loops and conditionals.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the programs in this project, you will need a C compiler installed on your computer. The GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) is a popular choice.

- **Install gcc on Ubuntu/Debian**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install gcc
